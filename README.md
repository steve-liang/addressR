# addressR

This project aims to establish an R framework to perform US Address Validation using USPS Web API. I am also building a shiny app to manage one single and batch address validating job.

To run the shinyapp, simply navigate to shiny-app/ folder and `shiny::runApp()`

For the UI design, I am testing shinymaterial/shinyWidgets/and more
